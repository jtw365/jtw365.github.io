<p>I'm 25 years old, married and have an adorable 1 year old girl.  I'm learning coding because I love all the possibilities and opportunities that can come with it.  I really enjoy the fact that it is ever-changing and I'll always be able to learn more.  I'm a huge NBA fanatic!  I also am a passionate Kanye West fan.  Random, but I'm incredibly good at Connect 4.  Oh, I also have a Bachelor's Degree in Media Production.</p>
