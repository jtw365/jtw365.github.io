When I first started the Bootcamp Prep course, I asked myself why didn't you think about Software Development as a career when I started college?  It didn't even cross my mind once.  Maybe I thought there's no way I could be smart enough to do it.  Maybe I didn't know anyone that did any developing to tell me how cool it is.  I'm not sure, but I'm happy that I've learned more about it and have started to purse a career in Software Development.  My whole life I've loved to tap into my creative side.  Whether it's writing stories, short screenplays, etc., I've always loved to create.  I've always loved technology, whether it's the newest phone, laptop, apps, websites.  I think software development can combine my passions of creating and tech.  I have ideas of different applications and softwares that may be really, really dumb or could be really cool and possibly close a need other people have.  I figure I will never know if I don't at least try to create it. I also love learning and think in the future it will be really important to have at least a working knowledge in this field.  Lastly, I want to make a fairly good income, so I think a good software development job can help me with that.
